# Merry Bird

![Responsive Mockup](https://mwresearch.github.io/merry-birds/doc_assets/cover.webp)

Why bother with angry birds when there are happy birds too?  
This is Merry-Bird, a simple javascript game that’s meant to be funny and relaxing. That’s all.
Your goal is to keep this bird happy till the end of the game. But watch out for the walls and obstacles, because they move towards you with an increasingly faster speed.

Indeed, this is my first more or less serious computer game that I’ve created. This is a Project for my coding exercise. So don’t expect too much from it in this very first development stage, but things get better over time.

This game is suitable for all enthusiasts of all ages.

## Specifications

- This game works with all modern Webbrowsers that support Javascript ES6 version and HTML5+CSS3.
- This layout  design is responsive and works on mobile and desktop devices. On mobile devices I recommend to use Landscape mode (Horizontal orientation).

## Game rules 

Avoid hitting the walls. With each crash you loose a heart.   After loosing all hearts it’s game over.  
After passing every wall, game speed increases slightly.  Each crash increases the speed even more.
So keep merry bird calm and happy.

## Screenshots

This game is simple and self explanatory. Here you can see some screenshots from this game.

### Features Left to Implement

- an on-off button for the control-buttons
- a lot of things...

### In future versions:
I will add more game levels and rules and features in future versions, to make this game more exciting and fun. 

## Testing

- JS  
jshint.com didn't show any problems.

### Performance Tests

This game works perfectly fine on desktop computers. On mobile devices should also be no performance problems, except the control-button bug that needs to be fixed.
I used Chrome-Lighthouse for this test.

### Unfixed Bugs

- For some strange reasons the bird is able to fly away at  the corner of the window. This way you can place the bird out of the window and overcome all the walls and cheat!
- Control-buttons don’t work on some mobile devices for now.

## Deployment 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
